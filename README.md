# PSWorkItem

This is my personal playground copy of [Jeff Hicks](https://github.com/jdhitsolutions "link to Jeff Hicks' Github profile")' repository for his [PSWorkitem](https://github.com/jdhitsolutions/PSWorkItem "link to PSWorkItem git repository on Github") PowerShell module.

I create playgrounds like this to learn from. Sometime I just want a copy of my own for reference. Others I may further develop through experimentation and play. Most will never become a finished product of my own. Wherever possible please refer to, work with, and contribute to the original.

## Branch information - psm1.1
| Name | Description |
| :----- | :----- |
| Branch name | psm1.1 |
| Description | Change `.psm1` file to explicitly load script files instead of using 'catch all' type code such as `Get-ChildItem -Path ".\" -Recurse -Filter "*.ps1"`. |
| Learning goal | Better understand what the supporting files are and how they affect the module as a whole. |
